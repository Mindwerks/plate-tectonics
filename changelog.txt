V 1.4.4
-------
* Fixed Issue #30: Mass values go below zero due to floating point precision errors
  - Added clamping of heightmap values to prevent negative values after erosion
  - Modified mass tracking to clamp negative values to zero instead of asserting
  - Added comprehensive tests to verify the fix with problematic seeds
* All existing tests continue to pass

V 1.4.3
-------
* Build system improvements and Python packaging updates
* Updated Python wheel building for Python 3.9-3.14
* Improved cross-platform compatibility

V 1.4.2
-------
* Minor bug fixes and stability improvements
* Code cleanup and maintenance updates

V 1.4.1
-------
* Update to C++17 standards
* Make use of noexcept
* Clean up typos

V 1.4.0
-------

V 1.3.1.post1
-------------
* Fix the source distribution

V 1.3.1
-------
* Fixing minor bugs here and there
* Reducing noise of the initial map and revising noise in general

V 1.3
-----
* Renaming the version: given we have a perfectly viable project it makes sense to have a version number > 1.0,
  moreover we want it to be aligned to pyplatec
* Major refactoring. Plate and Lithospere classes have been disassembled in many smaller classes, methods
  have been divided and >50 tests have been written.

V 0.2
-----
* Using random function stable across platforms
* Using simplex noise in some cases
* Working towards supporting rectangular maps
* Trying to simplify code

V 0.1
-----
* Imported code from Platec
* Added CMake build files
* Started writing tests with googletest
* Configured build integration with Travis
