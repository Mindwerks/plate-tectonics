V 0.1
-----
* Imported code from Platec
* Added CMake build files
* Started writing tests with googletest
* Configured build integration with Travis

V 0.2
-----
* Using random function stable across platforms
* Using simplex noise in some cases
* Working towards supporting rectangular maps
* Trying to simplify code

V 1.3
-----
* Renaming the version: given we have a perfectly viable project it makes sense to have a version number > 1.0,
  moreover we want it to be aligned to pyplatec
* Major refactoring. Plate and Lithospere classes have been disassembled in many smaller classes, methods
  have been divided and >50 tests have been written.

V 1.3.1
-------
* Fixing minor bugs here and there
* Reducing noise of the initial map and revising noise in general

V 1.3.1.post1
-------------
* Fix the source distribution

V 1.4.0
-------
* Great improvement in performance (up to 6 times faster!). This was done by Matthew Kenneally
